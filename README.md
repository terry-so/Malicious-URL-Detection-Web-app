A web application that uses an extra-tree model to detect malicious URLs in real-time. This project covers the full process: training a model, finding the best hyperparameters, and deploying it as a live web application that anyone can use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, PyCaret, Pandas
-   **Backend API**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
-   **Frontend UI**: Streamlit
-   **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces (Backend), Streamlit Community Cloud (Frontend)
-   **Containerization**: Docker

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project is a web app with two parts: a FastAPI backend for the model and a Streamlit frontend for the user interface.
-   The **FastAPI backend** is responsible for loading the trained model pipeline and serving predictions.
-   The **Streamlit frontend** provides a simple user interface that sends requests to the FastAPI server and displays the results.

This decoupled design makes the application more scalable, maintainable, and robust.

## ‚ú® Features

### Machine Learning Pipeline
-   **Feature Engineering**: Engineered over 15 lexical features from raw URLs, including URL length, character ratios, and the presence of suspicious patterns.
-   **Model Training**: Used PyCaret to efficiently compare multiple models and selected an Extra Trees Classifier for its high performance.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized the final model using PyCaret's automated tuning, achieving **86% accuracy** on the test set.
